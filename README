### Under The Hood

We set this up to show learners how to use HTML, CSS, a CSS Framework (W3.CSS), and Web Fonts (Google Fonts) to create a webpage. We also use GitHub Pages for hosting.

### How Do I Find This Again?

We have given you a VERY easy way to visit the page again. The domain name,http://clovemill.com, is setup to point directly to the GitHub Pages URL for this project.

Just visit http://clovemill.com in your browser to see the web page.

Note, because this is a simple GitHub project for educational purposes and not a business, there is no SSL certificate for the domain name. Don't worry though, http://clovemill.com is only a shortcut to the secure link provided by GitHub. And GitHub has excelent security.

If you would prefer, you can access it via https://clovemill.github.io/clovemill.

### Copyright?

Ha, there is no copyright or restrictions on this, well, apart from the Clove Mill name and domain name.
